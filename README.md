# evilfactorylabs RNDC

an overlooked yarn against modern technologies.

## Background

### Short history

Modern technologies moves fast, innovation such as UI frameworks with
VDOM approach, new backend framework with great benchmark,
cloud-native infrastructure, brand-new platform, new programming language,
and various useful tools for our chore are born rapidly and grow incrementally.

Documentation are boring and basically people are looking for a shortcut to help
them adopt those technologies faster. Tutorial is a great resources but unfortunately
they only talk about the surface...

...from the "X technologies advocate" perspective.

Which is basically only talk "the good part".

We are independent enough, we use those technologies because it solves our problem.

We want to talk about those technologies in free perspective, talking about
both on the surface and below it, and talking all overlooked topics related with that
technology.

### Problem trying to solve

- "Unboxing" uncovered topic by major tutorials
- Talking both the good & the bad parts related with topic
- Depth explanation related with topic

## Key Concepts

- Template-driven
- Major adoption
- Free perspective

## Core Features

- Boring topics
- In-depth explanation
- Based on data

## Under the hood (Key Concepts)

### Template-driven

All reports done based on [template.md](https://github.com/evilfactorylabs/rndc/blob/master/template.md) which is
rarely changes. In meta-level, this README.md was also based on `template.md`. We need to "standarize" our research
flow to prevent out-of-context topic, to making our research clear, and to welcome everyone in order want to create
their own.

This template is far from perfect, we absolutely update it incrementally. For now this template is perfect enough for us.

### Major adoption

We only talk about technologies which is has major adoption on industries or becoming the hype train so
the internet (and watercooler talk) are surrounded with those topics.

### Free perspective

React developers are basically talking about the good part of React, and so on with Vue, Node.js, Serverless, etc etc.

They do that because they good on that. And they want people are using it because that was their job, as an "advocate".

We are independent enough, we not recommend people to use what we talk about. We only "share our discovery" related with
the topic, something like "are we use it?" or "should I use it?" is not our business. Absolutely we are using it for research
purpose, and some because we actually use it which is can be discovered on [our blog](https://blog.evilfactory.id).

## Core Features

### Boring topics

Do you even care what `Host tree` and `Host instance` is on React?

Or, what is event loop anyway on Node.js?

We do.

Basically we are only interesting with the "surface" like public API, basic concept, etc etc. But we don't.

We are interesting with under-the-hood topic so we can use it and solve our problem with it. Not blindly use it,
or like use it because everyone are using it.

### In-depth explanation

Do you even care what "Fiber" on reconciliation is? Hey what is reconciliation and why should I even care? 

Under the hood topic are interesting, so we can answer a question like "Why should we use React in our web-based game?"
with answer "Because React was using Fiber in rendering, so all updates are scheduled based on its priority to keep
the UI smooth, without glitch or even blocking the user interaction"

How did we know that? You know the answer.

### Based on data

One of reason why we publish it biweekly was because we took ~7 days to collect the datas. The truth. We do read
source code, depth explanation from core team, etc etc. We (basically everyone) hate assumption, although we are storyteller
but we use data from our story. A real insight.

Because that was our job.

## Ecosystem

We don't find yet in Indonesia who has the same interest with us, poor us. In abroad, there are like Increment by Stripe,
Web Fundamentals by Google, MDN by Mozilla, etc etc which is have a great reputation and capabilities.

And we don't. But we have responsiblity.

## Stats

### Complexities

If you wish this was a tutorial, you are on the wrong place. Probably visiting
[our blog](https://blog.evilfactory.id) was the right choice?

Like in the laptop, for example we cover something like CPU, GPU, processors, etc etc which is... The boring part. Like,
people only care about "what brand" my CPU & GPU is, how much RAM on this laptop, etc. Why should even
care with [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) that processor speed will doubled every year so
the laptop from 2017 is faster than laptop from 2016? Although this law is not "accurate" nowadays.

### Adoption

We have cover this topic on Ecosystem section, please take a look.

### Alternatives

We might not have a great reputation and capabilities, you can take a look to:

- Increment by Stripe
- Web Fundamentals by Google
- MDN by Mozilla

As an alternative...

..Which is represented by a company, not "community" like us.

## Conclusion

We care with this rapid innovation and trying to see it from different perspectives and share
our thoughts to the internet. We create both tutorial & reports so our audience can following the tutorial
without blindly choose it.

We are far from perfect, that's why we open all our
contents to public in [free culture](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)manner. So everyone can make this better.
